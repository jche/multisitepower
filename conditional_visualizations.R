# THESE ARE THE OPPOSITE(ISH) OF THE OTHER COVERAGE PLOTS!
#  - single-site coverage is curved (when the estimate is extreme, it's probably wrong)
#  - MLM coverage is (almost) flat!
# MLM coverage dips down at tau, because shrinkage pulls everything toward tau,
#  meaning that sites with tau_j \neq tau are estimated as approximately tau
#  - this is extra bad when tx_sd is low, and we estimate zero cross-site variance
#  - degenerate models happen more with FIRC than with Bayes
